## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone 
cd Deribit_TestAPI_GoQuant
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Install `vcpkg` (if not already installed):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```
2. Install required packages:

```bash
.\vcpkg install drogon curl openssl jsoncpp
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root directory with the following content:
```bash
API_KEY=your_api_key
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```
Replace `your_api_key` and `your_secret_key` with your Deribit API credentials.

### Step 4: Configure CMake
Create a `CMakeLists.txt` file with the following content:
```bash
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(GoQuantOEMS)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

# Set VCPKG
set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake)
set(VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET "x64-windows")

# Find required packages
find_package(Drogon REQUIRED)
find_package(CURL REQUIRED)
find_package(OpenSSL REQUIRED)
find_package(JsonCpp CONFIG REQUIRED)

# Add executable
add_executable(goquant_oems GoQuantOEMSApp/main.cpp GoQuantOEMSApp/web_socket_client.cpp GoQuantOEMSApp/order_manager.cpp GoQuantOEMSApp/utility_manager.cpp GoQuantOEMSApp/token_manager.cpp GoQuantOEMSApp/api_credentials.cpp ) 

# Link libraries
target_link_libraries(goquant_oems Drogon::Drogon ${CURL_LIBRARIES} ${OPENSSL_LIBRARIES} JsonCpp::JsonCpp)
```

### Step 5: Build the Project
Open the project folder in Visual Studio 2022.
Open `CMakeLists.txt` in Visual Studio.
Right-click on the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the Solution Explorer and choose `Build`.

### Step 6: Run the Project
Run the `goquant_oems` executable generated by the build process.

## Environment Variables
- API_KEY: Your Deribit API key.
- SECRET_KEY: Your Deribit API secret key.

## Error Handling
The application handles various errors, such as failed order placements or WebSocket reconnections. Errors are logged and printed to the console.
In case of error Failed to find access_token.txt, clone the repository again, and from the "Deribit_TestAPI_GoQuant\out\build\x64-Debug",copy and store the access_token,refresh_token ,api_key and api_secret texts files, and after reconfiguration of CMake ,paste them again. (As i am giving this assignment for review I am providing my api_key and api_secret for testing)
